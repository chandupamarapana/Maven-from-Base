This repository serves as a hands-on learning environment of the foundational concepts of Maven 

What is the process of building a Java file?

1) writing the source code : The process starts with writing the java source code in .java
2) compilation : the source code is compiled into bytecide using "javac" compiler, producing ".class" files
3) packaging : the compiled classes, along with the other resources like configuration files, are packaged into a JAR(Java Archive) or WAR (Web Archive) file.
4) Testing : Automated tests are run to ensure the code brhaves as expected
5) Deplyment : The packaged application is deployed to a runtime environment.

Why do we use a build tool for a java project ?

Build tools automate the process of buidling and managing projects, providing several benefits.

1) dependency Management : Automatically downloads and includes necessory libraries.
2) Consistent Builds : Ensures the same build process and includes necessory libraries.
3) Automation: Automates repitive tasks like compilations, Packaging, and testing.
4) Project Configuration : Standardizes project structrure and Configurations.

Why Specifically do a lot of people use Maven as their Building tool?
